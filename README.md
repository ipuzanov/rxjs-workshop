# example code from RxJS Workshop

Before running, make sure to install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Each example has its own server(or multiple servers), so you need to `cd` into that folder and run `node server.js`.

Examples separated into 2 folders `ui` and `uirx`, which contain example without RxJS and with it respectively.
Some of `uixx` folders will require you to run webpack build in order to build it.
